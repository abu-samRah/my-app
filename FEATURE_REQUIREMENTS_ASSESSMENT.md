# Feature Requirements Assessment - Pell Rich Editor

## üìã Required Features

Based on product requirements, the editor must support:

1. **Auto-Link Detection** - Paste URL ‚Üí Automatically convert to clickable hyperlink
2. **Auto-Bullet List** - Type "- " ‚Üí Convert to bullet point
3. **Auto-Numbered List** - Type "1. " ‚Üí Create numbered list item
4. **Text Selection** - Press & hold ‚Üí Select, Select All, Copy, Paste

---

## üîç Assessment Results

### Feature 1: Auto-Link Detection
**Status:** ‚ùå **NOT SUPPORTED**

#### What Was Expected:
- User pastes a URL (e.g., `https://www.example.com`)
- Editor automatically detects it's a URL
- URL becomes a clickable hyperlink
- Clicking the link redirects to destination

#### What Actually Happens:
- URL is pasted as plain text
- No automatic detection or conversion
- User must manually:
  1. Select the URL text
  2. Click "Insert Link" toolbar button
  3. Enter the URL again in dialog
  4. Confirm to create hyperlink

#### Technical Reason:
- `react-native-pell-rich-editor` is based on Pell.js (minimal WYSIWYG editor)
- Pell.js focuses on toolbar-driven formatting
- No built-in URL detection algorithm
- No `pasteAsLink` or `autoLink` prop available
- WebView doesn't have autolink plugin

#### Workaround Available:
```javascript
// Manual link insertion via ref
richText.current?.insertLink('Link Text', 'https://www.example.com');
```

#### Would Require Custom Implementation:
```javascript
// Would need to implement:
const handlePaste = (event) => {
  const pastedText = event.clipboardData.getData('text');
  const urlRegex = /(https?:\/\/[^\s]+)/g;

  if (urlRegex.test(pastedText)) {
    // Parse and convert URLs to <a> tags
    // Inject into editor
  }
};
```

**Effort to Implement:** High - Requires custom paste handler, URL regex detection, HTML manipulation via WebView bridge

---

### Feature 2: Auto-Bullet List Creation
**Status:** ‚ùå **NOT SUPPORTED**

#### What Was Expected:
- User types "- " (dash followed by space)
- Editor detects the markdown-style pattern
- Automatically converts to bullet list (`<ul><li>`)
- User continues typing list items
- Pressing Enter creates new bullet point

#### What Actually Happens:
- "- " is typed as plain text
- No pattern detection
- No automatic conversion
- User must manually click bullet list toolbar button

#### Technical Reason:
- Pell.js doesn't include markdown shortcuts
- No `onKeyDown`/`onKeyUp` pattern matching built-in
- No markdown parser included
- Library designed for toolbar-driven formatting only

#### Workaround Available:
```javascript
// Manual bullet list creation
richText.current?.setContentHTML(
  '<ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>'
);
```

#### Would Require Custom Implementation:
```javascript
// Would need:
1. Listen to onChange events
2. Parse last characters typed
3. Detect "- " pattern
4. Get current cursor position
5. Delete "- " characters
6. Insert <ul><li> HTML
7. Focus cursor inside <li>
8. Handle Enter key for new items
```

**Effort to Implement:** Very High - Requires real-time text parsing, cursor position tracking, HTML injection, keyboard event handling across WebView bridge

---

### Feature 3: Auto-Numbered List Creation
**Status:** ‚ùå **NOT SUPPORTED**

#### What Was Expected:
- User types "1. " (number, period, space)
- Editor detects numbered list pattern
- Automatically converts to ordered list (`<ol><li>`)
- Continues numbering automatically (2, 3, 4...)
- Pressing Enter creates next numbered item

#### What Actually Happens:
- "1. " is typed as plain text
- No pattern detection
- No automatic conversion
- User must manually click numbered list toolbar button

#### Technical Reason:
- Same as bullet list - no markdown support
- Pell.js is toolbar-focused, not markdown-focused
- No pattern recognition system

#### Workaround Available:
```javascript
// Manual numbered list creation
richText.current?.setContentHTML(
  '<ol><li>First</li><li>Second</li><li>Third</li></ol>'
);
```

#### Would Require Custom Implementation:
```javascript
// Similar to bullet list, plus:
1. Detect "1. " or "[0-9]+. " pattern
2. Track numbering sequence
3. Auto-increment on Enter
4. Handle backspace to exit list
5. Support nested lists
```

**Effort to Implement:** Very High - Same complexity as bullet list, plus numbering logic

---

### Feature 4: Text Selection & Copy/Paste
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY SUPPORTED**

#### What Was Expected:
- Long press on text ‚Üí Selection handles appear
- Drag handles to adjust selection
- Context menu: Copy, Cut, Paste, Select All
- Standard clipboard operations work

#### What Actually Happens:
‚úÖ **Works perfectly** - Native WebView behavior

#### Technical Reason:
- WebView's `contentEditable` div provides this natively
- iOS and Android handle text selection at OS level
- No special implementation needed
- Standard clipboard API works

#### How It Works:
```javascript
<RichEditor
  ref={richText}
  // contentEditable WebView handles selection automatically
/>
```

**No Additional Work Needed** - This is the only feature that works out-of-the-box!

## üéØ Why Pell Editor Doesn't Support These Features

### Design Philosophy:
Pell Rich Editor (Pell.js) was designed as a **toolbar-driven WYSIWYG editor**, not a **markdown-aware smart editor**.

### Architecture Limitations:

1. **WebView Bridge Latency**
   - Real-time keystroke detection is slower through bridge
   - Pattern matching would add noticeable lag

2. **No Built-in Markdown Parser**
   - Pell.js focuses on HTML formatting
   - No markdown ‚Üí HTML conversion layer

3. **Toolbar-Centric Design**
   - Users are expected to use toolbar buttons
   - No keyboard shortcut system

4. **Minimal Philosophy**
   - Pell.js is intentionally lightweight (~3KB)
   - Adding auto-formatting would bloat the library

---

## üí° Alternative Approaches

### Option A: Extend Pell Editor (Not Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Keep current implementation
- Add features incrementally

**Cons:**
- Very high development effort
- Fighting against library design
- Performance concerns (WebView bridge)
- Maintenance burden
- Potential bugs with cursor positioning

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks of development + ongoing maintenance

---

### Option B: Switch to Markdown-Friendly Editor (Recommended)
Look for libraries with built-in markdown shortcuts:

#### Recommended Alternatives:

1. **react-native-markdown-editor**
   - Built for markdown shortcuts
   - Auto-list creation included
   - Lightweight

2. **react-native-cn-richtext-editor**
   - Markdown support
   - Auto-formatting features
   - Better for your use case

3. **@10play/tentap-editor** (ProseMirror-based)
   - Modern architecture
   - Extensible with plugins
   - Markdown shortcuts available
   - Better performance (native-first)

4. **Custom Solution with Slate/Draft.js principles**
   - Full control over features
   - Native text input (no WebView)
   - Best performance

---

## üîÆ Recommendation

### For Pell Rich Editor:
‚ùå **DO NOT PROCEED** if auto-formatting features are hard requirements

‚úÖ **PROCEED** if you can accept toolbar-driven formatting only

### Next Steps:

1. **Test Second Library** - Evaluate a markdown-focused editor
2. **Compare Results** - Side-by-side feature matrix
3. **Make Decision** - Based on which library meets requirements
